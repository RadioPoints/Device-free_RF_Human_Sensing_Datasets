# Device-free_RF_Human_Sensing_Datasets
The objective of the present work was the counting of the number of people in a room using device-free WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) measurement and processing.

This repository contains the dataset that was collected and processed with the objective of counting the number of people in a room using device-free WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) measurement and processing.

WiFi CSI data are extracted from the received packets by using a modiﬁed version of a open-source wireless driver for the Intel IWL-5300 WiFi card. We carried out WiFi CSI collection on three diﬀerent rooms, see uploaded Figure.

CSI measurements have been collected for each class of people (from 0 to 7) and for each room.

The collected CSI data can be processed for feature extraction, feature selection and classiﬁcation tasks.
